Craft a ghazal that embodies the spirit of a seeker embarking on a path of self-improvement, drawing
upon the introspective wisdom of Mirza Ghalib, the emotional depth of Begum Akhtar, and the simplicity of
Jagjit Singh's expressions. Address 'NAME' directly, offering encouragement and insight into the pursuit
of knowledge and the dedication required for personal growth. Focus on creating each couplet with
deliberate thought, ensuring that they are self-contained in their meaning while also contributing to the
overarching theme of the ghazal. Maintain a consistent rhyming scheme and refrain from adding unrelated
introductory or concluding statements. The final couplet should resonate with a powerful message that
motivates 'NAME' to embrace the day with purpose and learning. Remember to think step by step, carefully
crafting the verses without straying from the prompt's intent.
