# What ? 
- This is a sample app that generates a motivational quote everyday
- The quote is basically a ghazal, that you can tag to anyone by passing a queryParam, example : 
?name=jalotra

# Why ? 
- Was getting bored, so tried to do something using Web2.0 and GPT
- Is this scalable ? Nope, the program has a 1 day cache so that the GPT calls are minimised.
- And the model being used is `gpt-4turbo` although the modelType as per specs is kinda different.

# Demo ?
